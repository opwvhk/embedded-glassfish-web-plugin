Embedded GlassFish Web Plugin: Introduction

  The Embedded GlassFish Web Plugin allows you to create an {{{../instant_developer_experience.html}Instant Developer
  Experience}} where your web application is compiled and deployed to an
  {{{http://embedded-glassfish.java.net/}embedded GlassFish}} server providing the
  {{{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html}JavaEE 7 Web Profile}}. You can also let it
  provide the full JavaEE 7 API (or JavaEE 6) by tweaking the plugin dependencies.

  Starting version 2.1, changes in your web resources are picked up and become visible in the deployed artifact without
  requiring a restart.


* Goals overview

  This plugin has three goals:

  * {{{./run-mojo.html}glassfish:run}} is used to run the artifact in an embedded GlassFish instance.

  * {{{./start-mojo.html}glassfish:start}} is like the <run> mojo, except the build continues after statring the
    GlassFish instance.

  * {{{./stop-mojo.html}glassfish:stop}} is used to stop the GlassFish instance started with the <start> goal.


* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the plugin, as well as some configuration examples, are on the
  {{{./usage.html}Usage}} page. The specific configuration options that exist can be found from the
  {{{./plugin-info.html} Goals}} page.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}}.
